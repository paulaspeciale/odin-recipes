  <h2> Mayo Chicken</h2>
  <p>This mayo chicken is my favorite chicken recipe, which I learned while doing low-carb dieting. I prefer dark meat, so I use 4 legs and thighs. You can make this recipe with pork chops as well.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Â½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
   <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
   <li>Place chicken pieces into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir together mayonnaise, garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture over chicken; top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
   <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
